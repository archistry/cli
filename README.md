Archistry cli-js
================

This repository contains a Javascript implementation of the CLI
functionality we've been using and enhancing since 2006 based on the
TECode/command functionality.  Yes, I know it's another CLI library,
so if you're happy with what you have now, then this library isn't for
you.

Originally inspired by RedHat's popt, it has some similar features,
but it uses the Command pattern to define the actions to be taken
during parameter matching operations.
